# Organ and Tumor Segmentation on CT

In this project, we deal with the segmentation of organs, in particular kidneys, and tumors. We train two different neural networks on 3D CT scan images and compare their performance using the DICE score.

For the dataset, we use the images from the KiTS19 challenge which contain images from 210 patients (further denoted as samples) from three different planes (coronal, sagittal and axial plane).
